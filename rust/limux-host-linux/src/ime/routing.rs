//! Routing decisions for the per-pane IME — pure logic, no GTK or
//! ghostty FFI.
//!
//! Two GTK input-method contexts run side-by-side per pane: the
//! `IMMulticontext` (primary, owns ibus / fcitx5 / wayland slaves)
//! and a `GtkIMContextSimple` (fallback, drives libxkbcommon's
//! compose tables in-process). For every keypress we have to decide
//! which one sees the event first, and how the "compose is in
//! flight" latch transitions afterwards.
//!
//! The bug this exists to avoid: on Plasma 6 Wayland without
//! ibus/fcitx5, GTK's `wayland` slave claims AZERTY dead keys over
//! text-input-v3 (`filter_keypress` returns `true` and a preedit
//! fires with the bare dead-key glyph), but KWin never commits the
//! composed glyph. If we route a dead-key initiator through the
//! multicontext first, the fallback never sees it and the compose
//! silently aborts. So we bypass the multicontext for compose
//! initiators and for the follow-up keystrokes that complete the
//! sequence.
